# Workshops

* [Latency Injection](latency-injection/README.md) - This lab provides a basic introduction to setting up a Linux client, server, and router, configuring basic IPv4 static routing, and finally using tc to inject latency. This lab will be the basis for other labs that require latency injected, usually in order to simulate large geographic distances.
